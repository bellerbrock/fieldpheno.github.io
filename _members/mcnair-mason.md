Research Goals:

-Enable affordable scientific research for underfunded labs, citizen scientists, and underserved communities by creating simple, 3D printable designs

-Develop robust pipelines for plant taxonomic delimitation, minimizing impact on natural populations and maximizing data utility for conservation

-Use living collections (botanical gardens & arboreta), dried collections (herbaria), and breeding populations to provide answers for complex taxonomic questions

Plant Systems I work with:

-Cercis (Redbud)

-Sarracenia (Pitcher Plants)

-Allium (Onions)

-Oryza (Rice)

-Triticum aestivum (Winter Wheat)

-Zea mays (Corn/Maize)
